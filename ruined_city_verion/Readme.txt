Description: This is one of my bigger small projects, where I was testing lots of things.
It is FPS shooter with 7 weapons. I was also testing animations of my model file format.
MS Model editor is also packed within, but it's got some bugs.

I used my library mgbsoft.lib, which includes some basic 3D math functions, OpenGL
basecode, toggling fullscreen and changing resolutions (but I'm not sure if it works properly
everywhere) and so on. So if you want to compile code, you must add mgbsoft.lib (and also
freetype.lib) to your compiler library directory. They are included with source code.
