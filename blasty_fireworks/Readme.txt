//**************** BLASTY FIREWORKS ****************\\

Description: Blasty Fireworks is simple fireworks simulator. It allows you to throw some
fireworks on ground and then to start. It doesn't look bad, but I could add there some
special effects (maybe next time) :-).

I used my library mgbsoft.lib, which includes some basic 3D math functions, OpenGL
basecode, toggling fullscreen and changing resolutions (but I'm not sure if it works properly
everywhere) and so on. So if you want to compile code, you must add mgbsoft.lib (and also
freetype.lib) to your compiler library directory. They are included with source code.
